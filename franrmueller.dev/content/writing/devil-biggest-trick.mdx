> “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”

Here’s the 21st‑century version: **evil doesn’t wear horns anymore—it wears Patagonia vests and shows up on CNBC earnings calls.**

Let’s be clear: nobody wakes up in the morning, pours a double espresso, and says, *“Today, I will maximize human suffering.”* That’s not how it works. What happens instead is far scarier: **rationalization.**

## Block 1: Rationalization at the Top

UnitedHealthcare’s leadership could describe “cost efficiency” and utilization algorithms as optimizing delivery; critics counter that such systems increase denials and degrade care. The executive in the mirror says he is fixing a broken market. The outcome on the ground often feels different.

Mark Zuckerberg frames Meta as “connecting people.” Meanwhile, research and public datasets point to troubling patterns:
- Rising youth anxiety and depression, with heavy social‑media use frequently correlated in studies.
- **Vast** youth-hours incinerated in doom‑scrolling.
- World‑class engineering talent redirected to optimize attention capture instead of, say, curing Alzheimer’s or building fusion.

But here’s the twist: Zuck believes he’s the good guy. He really does. And that’s the pattern. **Rationalization is a universal operating system.**

Not all rationalization happens in corner offices or boardrooms. It happens every day, in quieter lives. A lawyer at a pharmaceutical giant tells himself he is “defending innovation” while filing motions that keep life‑saving generics off the market. A contractor at a defense firm reassures herself she is “protecting freedom” while drafting proposals for weapons systems sold into endless conflicts. Both sleep at night with the same inner monologue: *I need to pay for my kids’ college. I need to cover my mother’s cancer treatments. I’m just doing my job.* This is how rationalization scales: not only through CEOs with press releases, but through thousands of professionals persuading themselves that their complicity is necessity.

**This is the devil’s true innovation: the conversion of evil into virtue by narrative.**

Once you see this, the world looks different. You stop waiting for a cartoon villain. You realize the devil doesn’t hide in shadows—he hides in mission statements.

## Block 2: The Banality of Evil Is a Feature, Not a Bug

Where does rationalization end and psychopathy begin? The line matters, because if everyone can rationalize harm, perhaps the devil doesn’t need villains—he can work through ordinary people like us.

**Rationalization is the universal condition.** It grows from cognitive dissonance: when our values and actions collide, we rewrite the story to end the conflict. A settler who bulldozes a home can tell himself he is “defending land,” “fulfilling history,” or “ensuring security.” He is not wringing his hands; he is preserving an identity as a good person. Challenge him, and he doubles down—because admitting otherwise would collapse the story he lives inside.

**Psychopathy is something else.** The psychopath feels no such dissonance. No guilt to soothe, no conscience to protect. They don’t need a story.

And here’s the paradox: **psychopathy is rare—rationalization is universal.** Most systemic evil in history wasn’t driven by a fringe of sociopaths but by legions of ordinary people rationalizing their participation—what Hannah Arendt called the *banality of evil*. Bureaucrats didn’t wake up plotting atrocities; they told themselves they were following rules, serving order.

Because when enough people cling to self‑justifying narratives, **evil doesn’t need to be intentional. It becomes ambient, systemic, invisible.** That’s the devil’s trick. He doesn’t need psychopaths. He only needs rationalizers.

## Block 3: The Psychopaths at the Controls

If rationalization is the operating system of the many, psychopathy is the weapon of the few. Psychopaths don’t waste energy on self‑deception. They operate without the burden of conscience, guilt, or empathy—and in a world built on stories, that absence is leverage: they can manipulate the rationalizers.

Consider Jeffrey Epstein. He wasn’t spinning bedtime stories about “helping” or “advancing science.” He was a predator running exploitation—and, by many accounts, cultivating leverage over the powerful. His “genius,” if we can call it that, was recognizing how deeply others depended on their own rationalizations. It was enough to let them do it—then trap them in their hypocrisy.

Or consider Benjamin Netanyahu as a study in power tactics. He has mastered the use of fear, urgency, and moral framing to corner rationalizers—Western politicians eager to appear as defenders of democracy, leaders intent on protecting allies, journalists seeking access. He doesn’t agonize over dissonance—he **induces** it in others and exploits the defensive narratives that follow. Where the rationalizer doubles down to preserve a self‑image of goodness, the true predator doesn’t care about self‑image at all.

This distinction is ancient. **Machiavelli was a rationalizer.** In *The Prince*, cruelty and deception are justified in the language of necessity and statecraft. He wrote manuals for the machine operators—the men trapped between conscience and survival. But the predators, then and now, don’t need manuals. **They simply seize the wheel.**

## Block 4: The AI Boom as Collective Rationalization

Nowhere is the devil’s trick clearer than in the current AI boom. Today’s frontier models are powerful pattern machines—but they don’t truly *think*. The infrastructure isn’t ready either—power grids strain, data centers guzzle water, and costs explode. Yet the world’s most powerful CEOs insist we’re at the brink of salvation.

You’ve heard the refrains: “data centers on city‑scale footprints,” “democratizing knowledge,” “restructuring for the future.” Layoffs of tens of thousands are narrated as “focus.” Training runs sweep up copyrighted and creator work—often without consent—while court battles rage. Everywhere, the pattern is the same: **harm today in the name of a speculative tomorrow.**

And yet, the tech is not there. AI cannot yet reason, cannot yet create in the human sense, cannot yet replace us. What exists is hype dressed as inevitability. Water is drained, air polluted, bills skyrocketed, jobs erased—not because machines have replaced us, but because the *stories* told about machines have.

Imagine what happens if the technology truly arrives. If leaders will ravage resources and destabilize industries for tools that barely work, **what will they do the moment they hold something that really can replace us?** The rationalizations will only grow louder: *We are saving humanity. We are creating abundance. We are connecting the world.*

**The AI boom previews a future shaped less by the technology itself than by the rationalizations of those who control it.**

## Block 5: What Can We Do About It?

If the devil’s greatest trick is rationalization, our defense begins with clarity. Evil rarely announces itself. It comes disguised as innovation, security, duty, progress. It wears the mask of virtue. The first step is learning to see through the mask.

Cultivate suspicion toward institutional stories—and the stories you tell yourself. When a CEO justifies mass layoffs as “future‑proofing,” ask: *future‑proofing for whom?* When a politician invokes “security” to bulldoze a village, ask: *security for whom?* When you tell yourself you’re “just doing your job,” ask: *at what cost, and to whom?*

Remember: rationalization thrives in silence. Systems are human choices stacked over time. They can be unstacked, resisted, rebuilt. The banality of evil is powerful, but not inevitable.

Also remember: the danger of the future is not only the technology, but the humans who will justify its use. AI will not destroy us on its own; it is not conscious, not agentic. The danger is the executive who convinces himself that draining rivers and destabilizing jobs is progress, the policymaker who rationalizes surveillance as safety, the citizen who calls silence neutrality. **The machines are mirrors. What matters is the human face reflected back.**

Here’s the good news: **light is the best disinfectant.** We are not doomed. In many ways, we are better off than ever. For most of history, information was monopolized by rulers, priests, and corporations. Today, decentralized sources—open platforms, independent media, citizen voices—make it harder than ever for lies to stand unchallenged.

The “everything‑is‑on‑fire” feeling comes from suddenly seeing everything at once: every scandal, every hypocrisy, every rationalization in real time. That sensation is not collapse—it’s exposure. Those who depended on silence and monopoly are the ones cornered. They are running out of places to hide.

There is no silver bullet. But there is vigilance. There is the refusal to accept easy stories. There is the courage to name rationalizations for what they are: excuses. If rationalization is the devil’s trick, clarity is our counterspell.

The devil doesn’t hide in shadows. He hides in boardrooms, in press releases, in mission statements—and, most dangerously, in our own minds. Seeing him is the beginning of resisting him. And in the age of decentralization, once you see him, so can everyone else.
