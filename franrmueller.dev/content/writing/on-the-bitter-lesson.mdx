# Beyond the Bitter Lesson: Is Scaling Still Enough?

In 2019, Richard Sutton published [*The Bitter Lesson*](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html).

<Callout>
Scaling works—until it doesn’t. The next edge is **general learning + reusable modularity**.
</Callout>

## Why it mattered
- General methods + compute beat domain cleverness.
- Over time, specialized tricks get automated.

## Cracks in scaling
- Diminishing returns, data/compute ceilings.
- Shift toward test-time compute, retrieval, memory, tool use.

## Pragmatic takeaway
- Keep scaling in the loop, but engineer **composable abstractions**.
- Invest in data/infra; integrate with real workflows.

## TL;DR
General methods + compute beat hand-crafted cleverness—until diminishing returns push us toward reusable modularity.
